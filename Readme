CombatTag:
	Combat tag is a plugin for bukkit which prevents pvp loggers from getting away with logging.
	This plugin was originally created by marinating. 



Config file explanation:

npcName: 
This is the name of the NPC that you want to spawn. If you input "number", it will replace "number" with the NPC's number. If you put "player", it will replace "player" with the player's name. You can also put something like "playernumberxx". If I were to pvp log the NPC would be named something like "cheddar2621xx". If you don't put "player" or "number", the plugin will automatically append a number to the end of the name.
Beware: Putting the NPC name as just "player" will cause an incompatibility with Heroes, but it will allow their skins to show.
